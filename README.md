# docker-jikan 

Requires `docker`, `docker-compose`.

Personal Jikan setup adapted from [JikanDockerized](https://github.com/zunjae/JikanDockerized)

This changes the default values for the Jikan .env files to work for my projects, and uses the PHP server instead of the apache one (I had issues getting apache to work).

```
#./reset -- to remove old docker images
./run
```
